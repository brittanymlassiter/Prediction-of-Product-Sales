# Prediction-of-Product-Sales

Brittany Lassiter

## In this project, I will be implenting various sales and prediction over various stores for their sales for different food items. We will help the retailer understand the properties of products and outlets that play crucial roles in increasing sales. 

  #### As shown below, is a correlation's map, demostrating different highlights of production causing sales to be higher or lower.

#### Linear Data
------------------------------------------------------------
Regression Metrics: Test Data
------------------------------------------------------------
- MAE = 793.287
- MSE = 1,248,198.768
- RMSE = 1,117.228
- R^2 = 0.486

- ### Statement
- This model is able to predict on an average $1056 off of sales of the project, which will increase productions for better sales within each store.
